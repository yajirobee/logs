# Rollup & aggregation
- Aggregation: aggregate datapoints with different tags grouped by a query into 1 datapoint
- Rollup: roll up datapoints with the same tags in a rollup interval to reduce datapoints to show by a query.
  - By default, an hour long query shows a point every twenty seconds, while a four hour graph shows a point every minute.

[Rollup interval: enforced vs custom](https://docs.datadoghq.com/dashboards/functions/rollup/#rollup-interval-enforced-vs-custom)

> When graphing, Datadog sets a limit on the number of points per timeseries. To retain visual clarity, a series can have up to 1500 points. To respect this limit, Datadog rolls up datapoints automatically, defaulting to the avg method, effectively displaying the average of all datapoints within a time interval for a given metric.

> Queries for COUNT and RATE type metrics have the .as_count() modifier appended automatically in the UI, which sets the rollup method used to sum and disables interpolation.

[In-application modifiers](https://docs.datadoghq.com/metrics/custom_metrics/type_modifiers/?tab=count#in-application-modifiers)

- For "Count" metric type, effect of `as_count()` is disables any interpolation and sets the time aggregator to SUM.
- For "Gauge" metric type, `as_count()` and `as_rate()` have no effect.
