# package manager
## [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
> A single tool to replace pip, pip-tools, pipx, poetry, pyenv, twine, virtualenv, and more.

### migrate to uv from another package manager
Use [uvx migrate-to-uv](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv) tool

## [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
Poetry manages project configurations on the customer sections of python standard project configuration file [pyproject.toml](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/pyproject-toml/#pyproject-toml-spec).

## [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)
> Pipenv uses Pipfile and Pipfile.lock to separate abstract dependency declarations from the last tested combination.
