[Fournier, Camille. The Manager's Path](https://www.amazon.co.jp/Managers-Path-Leaders-Navigating-English-ebook/dp/B06XP3GJ7F)

2019年11月20日に購入して、先日ようやく読み終えた。同僚のすすめで読んでみたが学びが多かった。後の振り返りのために印象に残った箇所をメモしておく。

## 1. Management 101
- What to Expect from a Manager > Page 1 · Location 146
> Friends of mine talk about their best managers as managing them with “benign neglect.” The engineer just kind of knows what to work on, and the manager just leaves them alone entirely.

前提として、マネージャーはチームのスループットを最大化すること、タイムリーなデリバリーを実現すること、Individual Contributer (IC)はプロダクト、サービス、コードのデリバリーに責任を負う。ICの稼働の範疇で完結できるタスクについては、ICに権限を移譲することが適切。
ICはプロダクト、サービス、コードの特定の範囲について最も詳しいはずなので、その人間が判断できることが重要。

- What to Expect from a Manager > Page 3 · Location 175
> trust, real trust, requires the ability and willingness to be vulnerable in front of each other. So, your manager will hopefully treat you like a human who has a life outside of work, and spend a few minutes talking about that life when you meet.

信頼関係無しに権限を移譲することはできない。当然ながら信頼関係を構築するために、日常会話や1 on 1は重要なツールと思う。

- What to Expect from a Manager > Page 4 · Location 201
> Good managers know that delivering feedback quickly is more valuable

双方の記憶が鮮明なうちにフィードバックをすることが重要と思う。早期に指摘することで、改善のチャンスも多く得られるし、同じ過ちを繰り返すリスクも減る。

- How to Be Managed > Page 9 · Location 316
> Strong managers know how to play the game at their company. They can get you promoted; they can get you attention and feedback from important people. Strong managers have strong networks, and they can get you jobs even after you stop working for them.

ここはポイントが２点。
社内で何が重視され何が求められるかは、ICへの適切なフィードバックのためにも必要。
適切なネットワーク構築はチームのスループットを向上するためにも必須。

## 2. Mentoring
- Being a Mentor > Page 14 · Location 397
> The odds of you spending all of your time answering questions are slim compared to the odds that your intern will go off in the absolute wrong direction because he didn’t ask enough questions.

フィードバックを早期にと同じだが、方向性がおかしいことに気づいた場合は直ちに修正すること。失敗するまで待ってはいけない。

- Being a Mentor > Page 17 · Location 453
> A more subtle unspoken rule dictates approximately how long you are expected to struggle with something by yourself before asking someone else to help you.

わからないことについて、他人に質問するまでの時間の目安を明言するのはよい方法と思う。それをコンテキストとして共有することで受け手も質問が来ることを想定するし、質問者も躊躇しづらくなる。

- Being a Mentor > Page 17 · Location 455
> Unspoken rules don’t just make it harder for new people to join, they can also make it harder for you to do your job well. So take full advantage of this gift of fresh perspective.

組織の外から来た人から得られるフィードバックは貴重。その人が「組織内の人」になるまでの時間は極めて短い。

- Being a Mentor > Page 18 · Location 469
> You may be an introvert, or someone who does not find socializing easy, but conscious effort and practice in getting to know new people and helping them succeed will pay off.

新しい人とのネットワーク構築の労力を惜しまず、習慣化すること。

- Being a Mentor > Page 18 · Location 482
> This type of mentoring is usually not a formal relationship and may be an expected part of the job for senior engineers because it delivers so much value to the team.

シニアグレードではチーム外ともメンタリングの関係が自発的に形成されるべき。

- Good Manager, Bad Manager: The Alpha Geek > Page 21 · Location 528
> The alpha geek habit often starts to show up when engineers first become mentors. If you have ever wondered why people don’t seem to come to you for help despite your clearly strong technical skills, ask yourself whether you’re showing some signs of being an alpha geek.

テクニカルスキルがあるにも関わらず他人が相談にこない、アルファギークの一つの兆候。

- Tips for the Manager of a Mentor > Page 22 · Location 551
> but it applies here as much as anywhere else. When you need to assign a mentor for your new hire or intern, figure out what you’re hoping to achieve by creating the relationship. Then, find the person who can help meet those goals.

- Tips for the Manager of a Mentor > Page 22 · Location 553
> the mentoring relationship existed for a very specific purpose:

メンタリング関係を組むとき、その目的は明確でなければならない。メンターの時間をいたずらに奪ってはいけない。

- Tips for the Manager of a Mentor > Page 22 · Location 561
> Secondly, recognize that this is an additional responsibility for the mentor. If the mentor does a good job, her productivity may slow down some during the mentoring period. If you’ve got an engineer involved in a time-sensitive project, you may not want to push him into mentoring at the same time.

メンタリングによりメンターには一つ責任が増える。その分生産性が落ちることは明確に想定されなければならない。

- Key Takeaways for the Mentor > Page 25 · Location 618
> Senior engineers can develop bad habits, and one of the worst is the tendency to lecture and debate with anyone who does not understand them or who disagrees with what they are saying.

視座を合わせ、同じコンテキストでコミュニケーションをとる。一方的なレクチャーであったり、相手の理解していない内容、反対している内容について議論するのは最悪。

## 3. Tech Lead
- Page 27 · Location 649
> The idea that the tech lead role should automatically be given to the most experienced engineer, the one who can handle the most complex features or who writes the best code, is a common misconception that even experienced managers

Tech leadは最も経験あるエンジニアのポジションではない。確立した定義はないが、コードを書くだけではなく一定のグループのマネジメントにも責任を持つというのが例。

- Page 29 · Location 671
> The tech lead is learning how to be a strong technical project manager, and as such, they are scaling themselves by delegating work effectively without micromanaging.

- All Great Tech Leads Know This One Weird Trick > Page 31 · Location 714
> From now on, wherever you go in your career, balancing is likely to be one of your core challenges. If you want to have autonomy over your work, if you want the freedom to make choices about what you work on when, you must gain mastery over your time and how you use it. What’s worse, you’ll often need to balance doing things you know how to do and enjoy doing, such as writing code, with things you don’t know how to do.

コーディングとマネジメントのバランスをとることがTech leadの挑戦の一つとなる。

- Being a Tech Lead 101 > Page 33 · Location 758
> In a healthy organization, there is no shame or harm in raising issues early. Teams often fail because they overworked themselves on a feature that their product manager would have been willing to compromise on. As a large project nears its delivery date, there will be compromises on functionality.

健全な組織では課題は早期に周知される。情報がtransparentであることは組織の健全性の指標となる。

- Managing Projects > Page 35 · Location 807
> As you move forward in your career, you need to understand how to break down work that has complexity beyond the scope of what you can do as an individual.

マネージャーはタスクを適切にブレイクダウンする方法を知らなければならない。

- Managing Projects > Page 37 · Location 845
> I never hesitate nowadays to take the opportunity to explain basics and motivation to senior or junior members. It educates them without making them feel small, they learn to trust my judgment and advice, and we bring about change. Taking the time to explain is very important.

情報を正しく伝達することに時間を費やすべき。Poor communication creates more work.

- Managing a Project > Page 38 · Location 862
> The value of a good planning process is that it helps you know approximately how far the project has come, and approximately how far it is from completion.

よいプランニングプロセスとは、正確でなくともタスクがどの程度の時間や労力を要するか知ることができるもの。

- Managing a Project > Page 39 · Location 882
> Good managers are looking out for talented people who could be given bigger leadership roles, but sometimes this leads them to push people away from coding before they’re ready. This practice can have a very negative impact on your career, because at more senior levels people who are considered “not technical enough” can find it hard to be promoted into management positions with more responsibility. It’s much easier to stay in a focused individual contributor role and learn what you need to learn there than it is to try to learn all of those skills while also learning management skills.

自分のテクニカルスキルにある程度満足するまでマネージメントトラックに乗るべきでないといのが筆者の考え。これはよい指標と思う。
マネージメントのポジションに就く前に、マネージメントのリテラシーを挙げておくのも良いと思う。

- Good Manager, Bad Manager: The Process Czar > Page 46 · Location 1004
> As a new tech lead, be careful of relying on process to solve problems that are a result of communication or leadership gaps on your team. Sometimes a change in process is helpful, but it’s rarely a silver bullet, and no two great teams ever look exactly alike in process, tools, or work style.

プロセスに頼りすぎてはいけない。フィットするプロセス、ツール、ワークスタイルは、全てのチームで異なることを理解する。

- Good Manager, Bad Manager: The Process Czar > Page 46 · Location 1007
> If you find yourself playing the role of taskmaster — criticizing people who break the rules or don’t follow the process — see if the process itself can be changed to be easier to follow. It’s a waste of your time to play rules cop, and automation can often make the rules more obvious.

プロセスに違反したものを過剰に非難するような体制にするべきではない。人が合わせやすいようプロセスを変えることも常に選択肢に入れる。

- How to Be a Great Tech Lead > Page 46 · Location 1023
> If you’re doing all of the interesting work yourself, stop. Look at the tricky, boring, or annoying areas of technical need and see if you can unstick those areas. Working on the less exciting parts of the code base can teach you a lot about where the process is broken. With boring or frustrating projects, there’s often something obvious that can be spotted and fixed if an experienced person takes the time to look at them. If you’re only doing the most boring work, stop that, too. You’re a senior engineer who has a lot of talent as a developer, and it’s reasonable for you to take on some of the harder tasks. You want to encourage others on your team to learn the entire system, and you want to give them chances to stretch themselves, but you needn’t always be self-sacrificing in what you choose to work on. Give yourself a fun task occasionally, as long as you know you have the time to do it well.

Tech leadのポジションでは、シニアより下のエンジニアのために、成長の機会のためのタスクを残しておかなければならない。
チームのレベルを引き上げるのはシニアエンジニアの役割。

- How to Be a Great Tech Lead > Page 47 · Location 1042
> Successful leaders write well, they read carefully, and they can get up in front of a group and speak. They pay attention in meetings and are constantly testing the limits of their knowledge and the knowledge of the team. Now is a great time to practice your writing and speaking skills. Write design documents and get feedback on them from better writers. Write blog posts for your tech blog or your personal blog. Speak in team meetings, speak at meetups, and get practice standing up in front of an audience.

ライティングとスピーキングのスキルをあげる。リーダーには議論を先導することが求められる。

## 4. Managing People
- Different 1-1 Styles > Page 55 · Location 1194
> If you start focusing a lot of energy on hearing reports’ complaints and commiserating, you’re quite possibly making the problem worse. You don’t have to have a to-do list, but problems in the workplace need to be either dealt with or put aside by mutual agreement. There is very little value to repeatedly focusing on drama.
- Practical Advice for Delegating Effectively > Page 59 · Location 1294

- Creating a Culture of Continuous Feedback > Page 61 · Location 1347
> Some companies have started to adopt software that makes it easy for teams to provide continuous feedback and track that feedback over time, but the most important thing is that the team has adopted a culture of providing feedback frequently. For you, as a new manager, getting into the habit of continuous feedback is training you to pay attention to individuals, which in turn makes it easier to recognize and foster talent.

- Performance Reviews > Page 67 · Location 1457
> I usually give people a printed copy of the review as they’re leaving on the evening before the review is scheduled. This practice gives them a chance to read it at home, and then come to the meeting ready to talk about what it says. Even though they’ve had the review and gotten to read it, I still take the time to go over each section, starting with the strengths and accomplishments. Again, don’t let them skip over this and jump straight into the areas for improvement. Many people are uncomfortable being praised at length, but skipping that section undermines its value in reinforcing and encouraging their talents.

- Performance Reviews > Page 68 · Location 1476
> Real potential shows itself quickly. It shows itself as working hard to go the extra mile, offering insightful suggestions on problems, and helping the team in areas that were previously neglected.

- Cultivating Careers > Page 69 · Location 1502
> early-career staff, the answer is likely to be yes. These days, people fresh out of college tend to get promoted at least once in their first couple of years on the job, because they’re often hired in at an “up or out” level. To clarify, take the example of Famous BigCo. Famous BigCo hires engineers out of college at level E2 (level E1 is reserved for interns). Famous BigCo has a policy that an engineer who shows no sign of advancing past level E2 after two years at that level doesn’t have a future at the company. It has this policy for levels E2– E4, but at E5, you can stay forever. So, if you have a team of E2s and E3s, you need to be preparing them to be promotable every couple of years. Fortunately, this is usually straightforward. As long as you don’t stop them from getting promoted, they’ll be moved forward by the process. Your job with this group is to make sure that they’re learning how to estimate their own work, getting it done roughly within the estimates, and learning from their mistakes. The evidence for promotion often takes the form of projects or features they’ve completed independently, participation in on-call rotations or other support, and engagement in team meetings and team planning.

- Cultivating Careers > Page 70 · Location 1516
> You should also prepare yourself to start identifying promotion-worthy projects and trying to give those projects to people who are close to promotion.
- Challenging Situations: Firing Underperformers > Page 71 · Location 1542
> One of the basic rules of management is the rule of no surprises, particularly negative ones. You need to understand what a person is supposed to be giving you, and if that isn’t happening, make it clear to her early and often that she is not meeting expectations.

## 5. Managing a Team
- Staying Technical > Page 78 · Location 1660
> Strong engineering managers can identify the shortest path through the systems to implement new features. As you learned in your time as a tech lead, a critical part of complex project management is understanding the pieces of the system well enough to determine the best path to implementation. The more you understand the code in the system, the easier determining this path will be.

- Debugging Dysfunctional Teams: The Basics > Page 79 · Location 1694
> It turns out that releases can be a point of resource contention. When people are contending for a scarce resource, conflicts and unhappiness among team members are almost inevitable. Making the code-shipping resource far less scarce immediately improved team morale.
Hignhlight (yellow) - How to Drive Good Decisions > Page 85 · Location 1824
It’s easy to forget to review assumptions after the project is done, but if you make this a habit for yourself and your team, you’ll always learn from your decisions.

- Good Manager, Bad Manager: Conflict Avoider, Conflict Tamer > Page 87 · Location 1860
> there is such a thing as artificial harmony, and conflict-avoidant managers tend to favor harmony above functional working relationships. Creating a safe environment for disagreement to work itself out is far better than pretending that all disagreement does not exist.

- Good Manager, Bad Manager: Conflict Avoider, Conflict Tamer > Page 87 · Location 1863
> Don’t rely exclusively on consensus or voting. Consensus can appear morally authoritative, but that assumes that everyone involved in the voting process is impartial, has an equal stake in the various outcomes, and has equal knowledge of the context. These conditions are rarely met on teams where each person has different levels of expertise and different roles. As when the team voted down Charles’s work, consensus can be downright cruel. Don’t set people up for votes that you know will fail instead of taking the responsibility as a manager of delivering that bad news yourself.

- Advanced Project Management > Page 94 · Location 2008
> You have 10 productive engineering weeks per engineer per quarter There are 52 weeks in a year, or about 13 per quarter. However, realistically your team will lose a lot of that time. Vacations, meetings, review season, production outages, onboarding new employees — all of these things take away from focus. Don’t expect to get more than 10 weeks’ worth of focused effort on the main projects per team member per quarter.

## 6. Managing Multiple Teams
- Page 102 · Location 2129
> even if you don’t intend to write much code, I strongly advise you to keep at least a solid half-day once a week completely free from meetings or other obligations, and try to use this time at least partially on some creative pursuit. You might write blog posts for your engineering blog, prepare conference talks, or participate in an open source project. Do something to scratch that creative itch, which can otherwise be hard for you to scratch as a manager.

- Managing Your Time: What’s Important, Anyway? > Page 104 · Location 2183
> One example of an important but not urgent task is actually preparing for meetings so that you can guide them in a healthy way. Healthy meetings require involvement from all parties, and a culture that favors short but productive meetings requires that participants do some up-front work to come to the meeting prepared.
- Challenging Situations: Strategies for Saying No > Page 114 · Location 2368
> The best thing to do here is to work with your tech lead to give her the skills and confidence to ask for reports from other members of the team. It will be slower than stepping in and asking for them yourself, but you’ll teach the team to respect her requests and teach her how to lead the team independently.

- Measuring the Health of Your Development Team > Page 116 · Location 2407
> I bet if you honestly take a look at a team that isn’t releasing frequently, you’ll see cracks. The process of performing a release takes a long time. Engineers don’t feel ownership over their code quality, and they leave all of that work to a QA team, which creates a lot of back-and-forth communication delays. Rolling back code in the case of a bad release takes a long time. Things go wrong in the process of releasing that lead to incidents in production (or broken development builds). A whole host of ills in a team come from not being able to release frequently.

- Good Manager, Bad Manager: Us Versus Them, Team Player > Page 119 · Location 2487
> As a manager, be careful about focusing on your teams to the exclusion of the wider group. Even when you have been hired to fix a team, remember that the company has gotten this far because of some fundamental strengths. Before you try to change everything to fit your vision, take the time to understand the company’s strengths and culture, and think about how you’re going to create a team that works well with this culture, not against it. The trick is not to focus on what’s broken, but to identify existing strengths and cultivate them.

## 7. Managing Managers
- Skip-Level Meetings > Page 130 · Location 2673
> At this level, you’re constantly making tradeoffs between investing in expensive engagements, such as 1-1s, that can provide deep value but cost you in time and energy, or casual engagements that are more efficient in terms of your time but provide less detailed information. You won’t get it perfectly right. There will still be times when you hear too late about a project that’s suffering, or a manager who’s failing his team, or a team member who’s causing problems for others.

- Good Manager, Bad Manager: The People Pleaser > Page 135 · Location 2771
> People pleasers who focus externally can be a huge blind spot for their managers: because they’re so focused on only talking about good things and saying yes to everything that comes their way, their managers often don’t even know about problems on the team or within projects until it’s too late. These people can be very good at distracting you from your concerns. They have plenty of excuses.

- Good Manager, Bad Manager: The People Pleaser > Page 135 · Location 2776
> You might think people pleasers create teams that feel safe to be vulnerable and fail, but in fact the opposite is true. These managers make it hard for the team to fail in a healthy way, because of the manager’s own fears of failure and possible rejection. An externally focused people pleaser shuts down honest conversation by evasion and, if necessary, emotional manipulation that rests on his status as the person that everyone likes so much.

- Managing Experienced Managers > Page 139 · Location 2849
> Management tends to be a very culture-specific task in a company.

- Hiring Managers > Page 143 · Location 2934
> Sometimes changing the culture of an area is inevitable, and hiring in a new manager will hasten that change. You can use management changes to your advantage in this way. In fact, you see this frequently at growing startups, where they hire in more seasoned managers and executives to round out the lack of experience of the rest of the team. Sometimes this works incredibly well, and sometimes it’s a massive failure. No matter what, you will usually see attrition happening around the hire of these bearers of new and different culture, so proceed here with caution.

- Debugging Dysfunctional Organizations > Page 147 · Location 3016
> They often signal a lack of healthy conflict on a team. Good meetings have a heavy discussion element, where opinions and ideas are drawn out of the team. If the meetings are overscripted, so that no real conversation can take place, it stifles that creative discussion. If people are afraid to disagree or bring up issues for fear of dealing with conflict, or if managers always shut down conflict without letting disagreements air, this is a sign of an unhealthy team culture.

## 8. The Big Leagues
- Page 161 · Location 3263
> Decision making Taking conflicting perspectives and incomplete information and setting a direction, knowing that the consequences of a poor decision will impact both you and possibly the whole team. If making decisions were easy, there would be much less need for managers and leaders. However, as anyone who has spent a lot of time managing can tell you, making decisions is one of the most draining and stressful parts of the job.

- Models for Thinking About Tech Senior Leadership > Page 162 · Location 3297
> Technology strategy/ visionary Technology strategy meets product development. This person often also manages the product organization. He’s focused on how technology can be used to grow the business and works to predict the evolution of technology as it applies to the company’s industry. This differs from R& D in that the visionary isn’t usually focused on research potential; he uses business and technology trends to guide his decisions.

- Models for Thinking About Tech Senior Leadership > Page 163 · Location 3317
> Business executive, technology strategy, organization, and execution: CTO or Head of Engineering (VP/ SVP) R& D, technology strategy, external face of technology: CTO, Chief Scientist, Chief Architect, sometimes Chief Product Officer, usually for a company that is selling a software-based product Organization, execution, business executive: VP of Engineering, General Manager Infrastructure manager, organization, and execution: CTO/ CIO, possibly VP of Technical Operations Technology strategy, business executive, and execution: Head of Product (or Chief Product Officer), sometimes CTO R& nD, business executive: CTO or Chief Scientist, cofounder Organization and execution: VP of Engineering, sometimes Chief of Staff

- What’s a VP of Engineering? > Page 165 · Location 3337
> As the person in charge of the day-to-day operations of the team, a good VP of Engineering has a solid handle on processes and details. She’s capable of tracking several in-flight initiatives at once and making sure they’re all going well. Often a great VP of Engineering is described as having a good “ground game.” This person is capable of dropping into the details and making things happen at a low level. While some CTOs will do this, if there’s both a CTO and a VP of Engineering, the VP is usually the one pushing the execution of ideas, while the CTO focuses on larger strategy and the position of technology within the company.

- What’s a CTO? > Page 167 · Location 3381
> The CTO may identify areas where technology can be used to create new or bigger lines of business for the company that align with the overall company strategies. Or he may simply ensure that the technology is always evolving to anticipate and enable the potential futures of the business and product roadmap.

- Changing Priorities > Page 170 · Location 3438
> Priority changes from senior management can sometimes happen without warning. Leaders who are removed from the day-to-day schedules of the teams can forget that teams have long priority lists that may have been mapped out weeks or months ago and may take weeks or months to complete. So when these leaders see an opportunity or feel that the priorities of the organization need to change, they often expect that change to happen immediately, without consideration for the reality of the current state of affairs.

- Changing Priorities > Page 170 · Location 3449
> We forget that the people above us or in different organizations don’t have the same detailed understanding of what our teams are currently doing, and why. I don’t believe it’s necessary to constantly provide minute details to peers and your manager for every team in your large organization. However, when you’re taken to task for not focusing on the right priority, it’s a sign that you and the CEO have a misaligned understanding of reality, and you need to get on the same page. Your team may be crunching to stabilize a system that’s causing frequent outages, or in the last push of a major project that has been ongoing for a long time. If you think that the team needs to finish their current work before shifting to the new top priority, you must communicate that clearly.

- Changing Priorities > Page 171 · Location 3464
> Finally, never underestimate how many times and how many ways something needs to be said before it sinks in. Communication in a large organization is hard. In my experience, most people need to hear something at least three times before it really sinks in.

- Challenging Situations: Delivering Bad News > Page 177 · Location 3586
> Try to bring solutions, not problems to be solved. CEOs generally do not want to hear about how things are failing, nor do they want to hear about your disagreements with your peers or your troubles managing. In the case that you have a CEO who doesn’t want to hear too much about problems, respect that you’re not going to get much coaching from him on the management side of things, and find another person to get that from. With that said, don’t shy away from delivering bad news.

- Senior Peers in Other Functions > Page 178 · Location 3616
> you let them own their areas, and they let you own yours. Many of us learn how to do this earlier in our careers, when we have to work with senior designers, product managers, or other business team members, but if you haven’t learned how to let a peer own her specialty, now is the time. Giving her respectful deference when it comes to her turf is fundamental. If you disagree with her management style or application of her skill set in places where it isn’t directly affecting your team, you treat that disagreement like you would treat a good friend who happens to date people you don’t love. Unless she asks for your advice, try to stay out of it as much as possible, and certainly approach any disagreement you choose to discuss with kindness. Be willing to let those differences lie.

- The Echo > Page 181 · Location 3674
> You’re going to be part of hard decisions that will impact the whole business, and these decisions may cause you a great deal of stress. It won’t be appropriate to discuss these decisions with other people at the company. It’s deeply tempting to rant to those people you consider friends in your reporting team about the challenges of your position, but this is a bad idea. As their leader, you can easily undermine their confidence by sharing worries that they can’t do anything to mitigate. Transparency that may have been harmless or even possibly helpful at lower levels of management can become incredibly damaging to the stability of your team at this level.

## 9. Bootstrapping Culturep
- Page 192 · Location 3845
> you need to have a sense of what is important to you, to your company, and to your growing group of colleagues. Consider not only what you care about, but also how you can scale that knowledge and effort effectively as the company and team grows and evolves.

- Assessing Your Role > Page 197 · Location 3946
> My advice to leaders is simple: when failures occur, examine all aspects of reality that are contributing to those failures. The patterns you see are opportunities to evolve your structure, either by creating more or different structure or removing it. Think about how often the failure happens and its cost, and use your best judgment about the changes that need to be made. Using failure to guide evolution lets you apply structure at the right level.

- Cross-Functional Teams > Page 209 · Location 4191
> Prior to this project we had been deep in a pattern of “us versus them,” where your particular business function was “us” (tech, product, analytics, marketing, etc.), and the rest of the organization was “them.” Creating these collaboration units gave people a chance to see the whole group as “us.” It was a clear win in terms of organizational health, so we evolved our whole organization to have all product engineering performe
